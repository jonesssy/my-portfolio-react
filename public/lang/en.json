                "description": "Drawing from my experience as an electrician, I created this project to simplify floor heating cable selection. Using Java, Spring Boot, and a MySQL database running in a Docker container, I developed a backend system, complemented by a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to input area dimensions, installation methods, and power requirements to receive a tailored cable recommendation based on cables by Pistesarjat. It eliminates the need for manual calculations, making the process efficient and user-friendly.",
