    { title: "Who am I", content: "I am a 26-year-old student from HAMK University of Applied Sciences. I am studying for a Bachelor of Business Administration, and my field of study is computer science and telecommunications." },
    { title: "Roots", content: "I was born and raised in Finland. To be exact, I spent my entire youth on the eastern side of Helsinki, where I made many friends, learned the basics of life, and finally met my future wife. When I started my studies at HAMK University of Applied Sciences, I moved to HÃ¤meenlinna." },
    { title: "Education", content: "I studied to become an electrician and baccalaureate in 2016 at the same time. I deepened my electrician studies in 2019 during the coronavirus pandemic. Finally, in 2023, I thought, 'What would I REALLY like to do for a living?' After studying for a year at HAMK University of Applied Sciences, I think I have found the answer to this question." },
    { title: "Career", content: "My career as an electrician began in 2016 after graduation and continued for 6 consecutive years, excluding my military service. I showed excellent initiative, robust professionalism, and a sense of responsibility. I quickly progressed to the role of site manager and formed a deep trust between the employer and the customers. When I decided to change professions, I had a good understanding of everything and much of it in practice." },
    { title: "Motivation", content: "My family, of course. It includes my wife and our dogs, Uuno and Nasse. Of course, part of my motivation is my desire to advance in my career and my interest in the industry. I want to build a better world for the future." },
    { title: "Future", content: "Speaking of future, my goal within five years is to be a strong expert in software development. At the end of the day, senior software developer is a title I'm going to work hard for and achieve. There is no question of that. Alongside my studies, I also obtained work permits that would allow me to work as a light entrepreneur as an electrician alongside my main career. This way, I can make the most of my years of experience." },
